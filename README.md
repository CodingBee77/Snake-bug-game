# Snake Bug Game

This is a simple snake game using pygame module. The basic version hadonly one difficulty level, no menu, and a snake moved outside the screen.

I have based this project on tutorial from
[CodeBasics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F8zD42hQCA&list=PLeo1K3hjS3usBtsdSgNFe8LfVHPQ0Ynn5&ab_channel=codebasics)


I have modified it, adding:
- menu with 3 difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard with different snake speed
- snake bouncing off the border
- different background, sounds, and images.
